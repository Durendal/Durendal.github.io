  Hey there! My name's Brian and I'm a blockchain developer from Canada. I've setup this blog to help record my work and hopefully help others through processes and procedures that I had to blindly stumble my way through. I have a passion for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ethereum, and the potential they have to revolutionize technology and finance. As a result they will be the focus directly or indirectly of the majority of posts I make.

  Aside from that I enjoy cooking, playing video games, judging other people, and generally anything that has to do with building/hacking hardware and software.
